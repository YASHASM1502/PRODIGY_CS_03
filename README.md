## 🔐 Password Strength Checker using Python

### 🧾 Description

This Python script evaluates the strength of a user's password based on five key criteria:

1. **Length** – Minimum of 12 characters.
2. **Uppercase Letters** – At least one uppercase (A–Z).
3. **Lowercase Letters** – At least one lowercase (a–z).
4. **Numbers** – At least one digit (0–9).
5. **Special Characters** – At least one symbol (e.g., !, @, #, etc.).

Each satisfied condition adds one point to a total score. Based on the score (0–5), the password is categorized as:

* `Very Weak`
* `Weak`
* `Moderate`
* `Strong`
* `Very Strong`

If any condition is not met, the script also prints feedback with suggestions to improve the password.
